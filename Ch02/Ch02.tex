\chapter{Hypersurfaces of \texorpdfstring{$\bR^n$}{R^n}}\label{ch02}
In a very real sense, this chapter and the next are too special, i.e.,, much of the theory belongs to an arbitrary submanifold of a ``semi-Riemannian'' manifold. We specialize because we can obtain many of the concepts and results of classical differential geometry quickly and easily. In so doing, we hope to develop the ``geometric'' intuition of the reader sufficiently to make later generalizations and definitions seem natural.
