This chapter is a study of a general connexion on a $C^{\infty}$ manifold, the concepts belonging to the connexion, and the different ways of defining the connexion. These connexions are historically called affine or linear connexions on a manifold. The generalization to connexions in principal fiber bundles is sketched in section~\ref{ch05:s5}, but these generalizations will not be focused upon in these notes.
